## /rule

The Deny log on locally user right on member servers must be configured to prevent access from highly privileged domain accounts on domain systems and from unauthenticated access on all systems.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities.

The "Deny log on locally" user right defines accounts that are prevented from logging on interactively.

In an Active Directory Domain, denying logons to the Enterprise Admins and Domain Admins groups on lower-trust systems helps mitigate the risk of privilege escalation from credential theft attacks, which could lead to the compromise of an entire domain.

The Guests group must be assigned this right to prevent unauthenticated access.

## /implementations/0/description

Configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> User Rights Assignment >> "Deny log on locally" to include the following:

Domain Systems Only:
- Enterprise Admins Group
- Domain Admins Group

All Systems:
- Guests Group

## /checks/0/description

This applies to member servers and standalone systems. A separate version applies to domain controllers.

Verify the effective setting in Local Group Policy Editor.

Run "gpedit.msc".

Navigate to Local Computer Policy >> Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> User Rights Assignment.

If the following accounts or groups are not defined for the "Deny log on locally" user right, this is a finding.

Domain Systems Only:
