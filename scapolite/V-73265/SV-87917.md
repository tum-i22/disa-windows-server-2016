## /rule

System files must be monitored for unauthorized changes.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Monitoring system files for changes against a baseline on a regular basis may help detect the possible introduction of malicious code on a system.

[**Documentable**]{.separator type='STIG'}

false

## /implementations/0/description

Monitor the system for unauthorized changes to system files (e.g., *.exe, *.bat, *.com, *.cmd, and *.dll) against a baseline on a weekly basis. This can be done with the use of various monitoring tools.

## /checks/0/description

Determine whether the system is monitored for unauthorized changes to system files (e.g., *.exe, *.bat, *.com, *.cmd, and *.dll) against a baseline on a weekly basis.

If system files are not monitored for unauthorized changes, this is a finding.

A properly configured HBSS Policy Auditor 5.2 or later File Integrity Monitor (FIM) module will meet the requirement for file integrity checking. The Asset module within HBSS does not meet this requirement.
