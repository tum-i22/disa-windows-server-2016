## /rule

Zone information must be preserved when saving attachments.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Attachments from outside sources may contain malicious code. Preserving zone of origin (Internet, intranet, local, restricted) information on file attachments allows Windows to determine risk.
