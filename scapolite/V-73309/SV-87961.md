## /rule

Windows 2016 account lockout duration must be configured to 15 minutes or greater.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. This parameter specifies the period of time that an account will remain locked after the specified number of failed logon attempts.

[**Documentable**]{.separator type='STIG'}

false

## /implementations/0/description

Configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Account Policies >> Account Lockout Policy >> "Account lockout duration" to "15" minutes or greater.

A value of "0" is also acceptable, requiring an administrator to unlock the account.

## /checks/0/description

Verify the effective setting in Local Group Policy Editor.
Run "gpedit.msc".

Navigate to Local Computer Policy >> Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Account Policies >> Account Lockout Policy.

If the "Account lockout duration" is less than "15" minutes (excluding "0"), this is a finding.

Configuring this to "0", requiring an administrator to unlock the account, is more restrictive and is not a finding.

## /checks/1/description

IASE supplies an OVAL check.
