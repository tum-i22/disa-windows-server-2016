## /rule

The Server Message Block (SMB) v1 protocol must be disabled on the SMB client.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

SMBv1 is a legacy protocol that uses the MD5 algorithm as part of SMB. MD5 is known to be vulnerable to a number of attacks such as collision and preimage attacks as well as not being FIPS compliant.

[**Documentable**]{.separator type='STIG'}

false

## /implementations/0/description

Configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Administrative Templates >> MS Security Guide >> "Configure SMBv1 client driver" to "Enabled" with "Disable driver (recommended)" selected for "Configure MrxSmb10 driver".

The system must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

This policy setting requires the installation of the SecGuide custom templates included with the STIG package. "SecGuide.admx" and "SecGuide.adml" must be copied to the \Windows\PolicyDefinitions and \Windows\PolicyDefinitions\en-US directories respectively.
