## /rule

Users with Administrative privileges must have separate accounts for administrative duties and normal operational tasks.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Using a privileged account to perform routine functions makes the computer vulnerable to malicious software inadvertently introduced during a session that has been granted full privileges.

[**Documentable**]{.separator type='STIG'}

false

## /implementations/0/description

Ensure each user with administrative privileges has a separate account for user duties and one for privileged duties.

## /checks/0/description

Verify each user with administrative privileges has been assigned a unique administrative account separate from their standard user account.

If users with administrative privileges do not have separate accounts for administrative functions and standard user functions, this is a finding.
