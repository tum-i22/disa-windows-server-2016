## /rule

Systems must be maintained at a supported servicing level.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Systems at unsupported servicing levels will not receive security updates for new vulnerabilities, which leave them subject to exploitation. Systems must be maintained at a servicing level supported by the vendor with new security updates.
