## /rule

The Perform volume maintenance tasks user right must only be assigned to the Administrators group.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities.

Accounts with the "Perform volume maintenance tasks" user right can manage volume and disk configurations. This could be used to delete volumes, resulting in data loss or a denial of service.
