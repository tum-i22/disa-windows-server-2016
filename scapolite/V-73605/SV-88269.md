## /rule

The DoD Root CA certificates must be installed in the Trusted Root Store.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

To ensure secure DoD websites and DoD-signed code are properly validated, the system must trust the DoD Root Certificate Authorities (CAs). The DoD root certificates will ensure that the trust chain is established for server certificates issued from the DoD CAs.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000066-GPOS-00034, SRG-OS-000403-GPOS-00182
