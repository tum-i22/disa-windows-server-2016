## /rule

The built-in guest account must be renamed.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

The built-in guest account is a well-known user account on all Windows systems and, as initially installed, does not require a password. This can allow access to system resources by unauthorized users. Renaming this account to an unidentified name improves the protection of this account and the system.

[**Documentable**]{.separator type='STIG'}

false

## /checks/0/description

Verify the effective setting in Local Group Policy Editor.

Run "gpedit.msc".
