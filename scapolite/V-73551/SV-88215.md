## /rule

Windows Telemetry must be configured to Security or Basic.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Some features may communicate with the vendor, sending system information or downloading data or components for the feature. Limiting this capability will prevent potentially sensitive information from being sent outside the enterprise. The "Security" option for Telemetry configures the lowest amount of data, effectively none outside of the Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT), Defender, and telemetry client settings. "Basic" sends basic diagnostic and usage data and may be required to support some Microsoft services.
