## /rule

The Active Directory Domain Controllers Organizational Unit (OU) object must be configured with proper audit settings.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

When inappropriate audit settings are configured for directory service database objects, it may be possible for a user or process to update the data without generating any tracking data. The impact of missing audit data is related to the type of object. A failure to capture audit data for objects used by identification, authentication, or authorization functions could degrade or eliminate the ability to track changes to access policy for systems or data.

For Active Directory (AD), there are a number of critical object types in the domain naming context of the AD database for which auditing is essential. This includes the Domain Controller OU object. Because changes to these objects can significantly impact access controls or the availability of systems, the absence of auditing data makes it impossible to identify the source of changes that impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and systems throughout an AD domain. The lack of proper auditing can result in insufficient forensic evidence needed to investigate an incident and prosecute the intruder.
