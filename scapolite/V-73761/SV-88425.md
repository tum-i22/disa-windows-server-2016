## /rule

The Deny log on as a batch job user right on domain controllers must be configured to prevent unauthenticated access.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities.

The "Deny log on as a batch job" user right defines accounts that are prevented from logging on to the system as a batch job, such as Task Scheduler.

The Guests group must be assigned to prevent unauthenticated access.

[**Documentable**]{.separator type='STIG'}

false
