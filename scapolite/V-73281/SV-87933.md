## /rule

Windows Server 2016 must employ automated mechanisms to determine the state of system components with regard to flaw remediation using the following frequency: continuously, where Host Based Security System (HBSS) is used; 30 days, for any additional internal network scans not covered by HBSS; and annually, for external scans by Computer Network Defense Service Provider (CNDSP).

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Without the use of automated mechanisms to scan for security flaws on a continuous and/or periodic basis, the operating system or other system components may remain vulnerable to the exploits presented by undetected software flaws. The operating system may have an integrated solution incorporating continuous scanning using HBSS and periodic scanning using other tools.

[**Documentable**]{.separator type='STIG'}

false

## /implementations/0/description

Configure the operating system to employ automated mechanisms to determine the state of system components with regard to flaw remediation using the following frequency: continuously, where HBSS is used; 30 days, for any additional internal network scans not covered by HBSS; and annually, for external scans by CNDSP.

## /checks/0/description

Verify the operating system employs automated mechanisms to determine the state of system components with regard to flaw remediation using the following frequency: continuously, where HBSS is used; 30 days, for any additional internal network scans not covered by HBSS; and annually, for external scans by CNDSP.

If it does not, this is a finding.
