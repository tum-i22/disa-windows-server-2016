## /rule

The minimum password age must be configured to at least one day.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Permitting passwords to be changed in immediate succession within the same day allows users to cycle passwords through their history database. This enables users to effectively negate the purpose of mandating periodic password changes.

[**Documentable**]{.separator type='STIG'}

false

## /implementations/0/description

Configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Account Policies >> Password Policy >> "Minimum password age" to at least "1" day.

## /checks/0/description

Verify the effective setting in Local Group Policy Editor.

Run "gpedit.msc".

Navigate to Local Computer Policy >> Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Account Policies >> Password Policy.

If the value for the "Minimum password age" is set to "0" days ("Password can be changed immediately"), this is a finding.

## /checks/1/description

IASE supplies an OVAL check.
