Windows Server 2016 must be configured to audit Detailed Tracking - Plug and Play Events successes.

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. Collecting this data is essential for analyzing the security of information assets and detecting signs of suspicious and unexpected behavior.

Plug and Play activity records events related to the successful connection of external devices.
