## /rule

The machine inactivity limit must be set to 15 minutes, locking the system with the screen saver.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Unattended systems are susceptible to unauthorized use and should be locked when unattended. The screen saver should be set at a maximum of 15 minutes and be password protected. This protects critical and sensitive data from exposure to unauthorized personnel with physical access to the computer.
