## /rule

Software certificate installation files must be removed from Windows Server 2016.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Use of software certificates and their accompanying installation files for end users to access resources is less secure than the use of hardware-based certificates.

[**Documentable**]{.separator type='STIG'}

false

## /implementations/0/description

Remove any certificate installation files (*.p12 and *.pfx) found on a system.

This does not apply to server-based applications that have a requirement for certificate files.

## /checks/0/description

Search all drives for *.p12 and *.pfx files.

If any files with these extensions exist, this is a finding.

This does not apply to server-based applications that have a requirement for certificate files. Some applications create files with extensions of .p12 that are not certificate installation files. Removal of non-certificate installation files from systems is not required. These must be documented with the ISSO.

## /checks/1/description

IASE supplies an OVAL check.
