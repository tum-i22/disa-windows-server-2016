## /rule

Windows PowerShell 2.0 must not be installed.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Windows PowerShell 5.0 added advanced logging features that can provide additional detail when malware has been run on a system. Disabling the Windows PowerShell 2.0 mitigates against a downgrade attack that evades the Windows PowerShell 5.0 script block logging feature.

Uninstall the "Windows PowerShell 2.0 Engine".
