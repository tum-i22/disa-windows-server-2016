## /rule

Windows Server 2016 must be configured to prevent the storage of the LAN Manager hash of passwords.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

The LAN Manager hash uses a weak encryption algorithm and there are several tools available that use this hash to retrieve account passwords. This setting controls whether a LAN Manager hash of the password is stored in the SAM the next time the password is changed.
