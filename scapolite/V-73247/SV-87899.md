## /rule

Local volumes must use a format that supports NTFS attributes.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

The ability to set access permissions and auditing is critical to maintaining the security and proper access controls of a system. To support this, volumes must be formatted using a file system that supports NTFS attributes.

[**Documentable**]{.separator type='STIG'}

false

## /implementations/0/description

Format volumes to use NTFS or ReFS.

## /checks/0/description

Open "Computer Management".

Select "Disk Management" under "Storage".

For each local volume, if the file system does not indicate "NTFS", this is a finding.

"ReFS" (resilient file system) is also acceptable and would not be a finding.

This does not apply to system partitions such the Recovery and EFI System Partition.

## /checks/1/description

IASE supplies an OVAL check.
