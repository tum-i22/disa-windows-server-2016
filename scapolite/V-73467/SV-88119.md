Windows Server 2016 must be configured to audit Policy Change - Authorization Policy Change successes.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. Collecting this data is essential for analyzing the security of information assets and detecting signs of suspicious and unexpected behavior.

Authorization Policy Change records events related to changes in user rights, such as "Create a token object".

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000327-GPOS-00127, SRG-OS-000064-GPOS-00033, SRG-OS-000462-GPOS-00206, SRG-OS-000466-GPOS-00210

Use the AuditPol tool to review the current Audit Policy configuration:

Open an elevated "Command Prompt" (run as administrator).

Enter "AuditPol /get /category:*".

Compare the AuditPol settings with the following.

If the system does not audit the following, this is a finding.

Policy Change >> Authorization Policy Change - Success
