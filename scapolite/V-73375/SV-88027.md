## /rule

The Active Directory Domain Controllers Organizational Unit (OU) object must have the proper access control permissions.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

When Active Directory objects do not have appropriate access control permissions, it may be possible for malicious users to create, read, update, or delete the objects and degrade or destroy the integrity of the data. When the directory service is used for identification, authentication, or authorization functions, a compromise of the database objects could lead to a compromise of all systems that rely on the directory service.

The Domain Controllers OU object requires special attention as the Domain Controllers are central to the configuration and management of the domain. Inappropriate access permissions defined for the Domain Controllers OU could allow an intruder or unauthorized personnel to make changes that could lead to the compromise of the domain.
