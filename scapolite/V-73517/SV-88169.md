## /rule

Virtualization-based protection of code integrity must be enabled on domain-joined systems.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Virtualization-based protection of code integrity enforces kernel mode memory protections as well as protecting Code Integrity validation paths. This isolates the processes from the rest of the operating system and can only be accessed by privileged system software.

[**Documentable**]{.separator type='STIG'}

false

## /implementations/0/description

Configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Administrative Templates >> System >> Device Guard >> "Turn On Virtualization Based Security" to "Enabled" with "Enabled with UEFI lock" or "Enabled without lock" selected for "Virtualization Based Protection for Code Integrity".

"Enabled with UEFI lock" is preferred as more secure; however, it cannot be turned off remotely through a group policy change if there is an issue. "Enabled without lock" will allow this to be turned off remotely while testing for issues.

## /checks/0/description

For standalone systems, this is NA.

Current hardware and virtual environments may not support virtualization-based security features, including Credential Guard, due to specific supporting requirements including a TPM, UEFI with Secure Boot, and the capability to run the Hyper-V feature within a virtual machine.

Open "PowerShell" with elevated privileges (run as administrator).

Enter the following:

"Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_DeviceGuard -Namespace root\Microsoft\Windows\DeviceGuard"

If "SecurityServicesRunning" does not include a value of "2" (e.g., "{1, 2}"), this is a finding.

Alternately:

Run "System Information".

Under "System Summary", verify the following:

If "Device Guard Security Services Running" does not list "Hypervisor enforced Code Integrity", this is a finding.

The policy settings referenced in the Fix section will configure the following registry value. However due to hardware requirements, the registry value alone does not ensure proper function.

Registry Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
Registry Path: \SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DeviceGuard\

Value Name: HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrity
Value Type: REG_DWORD
Value: 0x00000001 (1) (Enabled with UEFI lock), or 0x00000002 (2) (Enabled without lock)
