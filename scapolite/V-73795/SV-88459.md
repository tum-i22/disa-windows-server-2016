## /rule

The Modify firmware environment values user right must only be assigned to the Administrators group.

## /description

Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities.

Accounts with the "Modify firmware environment values" user right can change hardware configuration environment variables. This could result in hardware failures or a denial of service.
