## /rule

User Account Control must virtualize file and registry write failures to per-user locations.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting configures non-UAC-compliant applications to run in virtualized file and registry entries in per-user locations, allowing them to run.
