## /rule

The US DoD CCEB Interoperability Root CA cross-certificates must be installed in the Untrusted Certificates Store on unclassified systems.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

To ensure users do not experience denial of service when performing certificate-based authentication to DoD websites due to the system chaining to a root other than DoD Root CAs, the US DoD CCEB Interoperability Root CA cross-certificates must be installed in the Untrusted Certificate Store. This requirement only applies to unclassified systems.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000066-GPOS-00034, SRG-OS-000403-GPOS-00182

Install the US DoD CCEB Interoperability Root CA cross-certificate on unclassified systems.

Issued To - Issued By - Thumbprint
DoD Root CA 2 - US DoD CCEB Interoperability Root CA 1 - DA36FAF56B2F6FBA1604F5BE46D864C9FA013BA3

DoD Root CA 3 - US DoD CCEB Interoperability Root CA 2 - 929BF3196896994C0A201DF4A5B71F603FEFBF2E

Administrators should run the Federal Bridge Certification Authority (FBCA) Cross-Certificate Removal Tool once as an administrator and once as the current user.

The FBCA Cross-Certificate Remover Tool and User Guide are available on IASE at http://iase.disa.mil/pki-pke/Pages/tools.aspx.

This is applicable to unclassified systems. It is NA for others.

Open "PowerShell" as an administrator.

Execute the following command:

Get-ChildItem -Path Cert:Localmachine\disallowed | Where Issuer -Like "*CCEB Interoperability*" | FL Subject, Issuer, Thumbprint, NotAfter

If the following certificate "Subject", "Issuer", and "Thumbprint" information is not displayed, this is finding.

If an expired certificate ("NotAfter" date) is not listed in the results, this is not a finding.

Subject: CN=DoD Root CA 2, OU=PKI, OU=DoD, O=U.S. Government, C=US
Issuer: CN=US DoD CCEB Interoperability Root CA 1, OU=PKI, OU=DoD, O=U.S. Government, C=US
Thumbprint: DA36FAF56B2F6FBA1604F5BE46D864C9FA013BA3
NotAfter: 3/9/2019

Subject: CN=DoD Root CA 3, OU=PKI, OU=DoD, O=U.S. Government, C=US
Issuer: CN=US DoD CCEB Interoperability Root CA 2, OU=PKI, OU=DoD, O=U.S. Government, C=US
Thumbprint: 929BF3196896994C0A201DF4A5B71F603FEFBF2E

Select "Computer account" and click "Next".

Select "Local computer: (the computer this console is running on)" and click "Finish".

Click "OK".

Expand "Certificates" and navigate to "Untrusted Certificates >> Certificates".

For each certificate with "US DoD CCEB Interoperability Root CA &#8230;" under "Issued By":

Right-click on the certificate and select "Open".

Select the "Details" Tab.

Scroll to the bottom and select "Thumbprint".

If the certificate below is not listed or the value for the "Thumbprint" field is not as noted, this is a finding.

If an expired certificate ("Valid to" date) is not listed in the results, this is not a finding.

Issued To: DoD Root CA 2
Issued By: US DoD CCEB Interoperability Root CA 1
