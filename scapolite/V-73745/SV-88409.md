## /rule

The Create a pagefile user right must only be assigned to the Administrators group.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities.

Accounts with the "Create a pagefile" user right can change the size of a pagefile, which could affect system performance.
