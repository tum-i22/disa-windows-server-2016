# DISA Windows Server 2016 STIG Evaluation

This repository is part of the paper *Automated Implementation of Windows-related Security-Configuration Guides* presented at the 35th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering.
We conducted all the steps described in our article on the [DISA Windows Server 2016 STIG benchmark](https://dl.dod.cyber.mil/wp-content/uploads/stigs/zip/U_MS_Windows_Server_2016_V1R13_STIG_SCAP_1-2_Benchmark.zip).
In this process, we marked every step with a distinct commit, e.g., [29118fd89617193143c73643ef1477de86ee0e0d](commit/29118fd89617193143c73643ef1477de86ee0e0d) and a tag, e.g., [step-8-export](releases/tag/step-8-export).
The commit view is especially handy if you want to see what was added, changed, or removed in a step.

If you have any question, please create an issue or contact [Patrick St√∂ckle](mailto:patrick.stoeckle@tum.de).
